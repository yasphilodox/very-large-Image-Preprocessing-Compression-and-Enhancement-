# Image Processing Project: Image Preprocessing, Compression, and Enhancement

## Description
This project focuses on a comprehensive approach to image processing, implementing various techniques for preprocessing, compression, contrast enhancement, and noise reduction. The project is structured into multiple steps, each addressing a specific aspect of image manipulation and analysis. The techniques utilized include geometric operations, image compression in different formats, histogram equalization, and noise reduction using linear filters.

## Project Contents
1. **Image Cropping**
   - Functionality to select a region of interest (ROI) from an image using mouse click coordinates.
   - Saves the cropped image for further processing.

2. **Image Compression**
   - Saves the cropped image in various formats: PNG, JPEG, GIF, and TIFF.
   - Compares the sizes and quality of the images in different formats.

3. **Error Calculation**
   - Implements functions to calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE) and structural similarity index between images.
   - Provides quantitative analysis of the differences between the original and processed images.

4. **Contrast Enhancement**
   - Functions for histogram equalization across RGB channels to improve image contrast.
   - Displays histograms of the original and processed images.

5. **Noise Reduction**
   - Implements linear filtering techniques, such as averaging filters, to reduce noise in images.
   - Allows for further enhancement of image quality.

6. **Visualization**
   - Utilizes Matplotlib for visualizing images, histograms, and the effects of processing techniques.
   - Displays side-by-side comparisons of original and processed images.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
